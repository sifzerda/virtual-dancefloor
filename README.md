(5) Messaging:
+ Live chat with matches over websocket 

## (8) Bugs and Further Development: 

+ ...
+ ...
+ ...

Optimization:
- use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel to optimize build output: Enable code splitting, tree-shaking, and minification to reduce bundle size and improve load times.
- Consider memoizing components to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially if their props rarely change.

## (9) To do: 

+ [ ] Home Page
+ [ ] Profile page
  + [ ] User model containing all the fields user can input data into, including their images/photos
  + [ ] Image upload
+ [ ] Profile display (carousel)
